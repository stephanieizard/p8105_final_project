##Team registration and proposal (instructions)
####First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a half-page to a page in length and include:
* The group members (names and UNIs)
* The tentative project title
* The motivation for this project
* The intended final products
* The anticipated data sources
* The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
* The planned timeline
* There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo 
* Conceptually, this is intended to review a project that is 10% complete.
