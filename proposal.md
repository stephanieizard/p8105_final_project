### Team registration and proposal

First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

#### Motivation

The motivation of this project is to use the Yelp dataset to look for trends in highly rated restaurants in the NYC and DC metro areas. Our goal is to use the data to generate relevant insights that can be used to inform restaurant goers through dynamic visualizations to help answer the age-old question, "I don't know, what are you in the mood for eating tonight?". Our final product will be an interactive, easy to navigate website containing relevant visualizations, graphs, and analytic results.

#### Data Source

We will be using the Yelp Open Dataset from 2018. [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) is a well known website that allows users to review and rate restaurants they've been to, so that this knowledge can be shared with others. Yelp users, or "Yelpers" have written over 163 million reviews since the website's inception in 2014, with 32 million unique users every month. This dataset was released for academic use in 2018, and can be accessed [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

#### Intended final products

#### The planned analyses, visualizations, and coding challenges

We plan to use linear regression to explore what covariates are associated with restaurant rating. We will look at the assoication between restaurant type andlocation, as well as restaurant type and income. We plan to use ggplot and plotly to create visualizations that consider geographical location, rating, and price of the restaurant in 2018 as well as longitudinally. Additionally, we plan to create visualizations that consider reviewer information, such as number of reviews and average rating. The primary coding challenge that we anticipate is uploading the Yelp data into R, as it is currently a JSON file and none of us are familiar with the jsonlite package yet.

#### Proposed timeline
